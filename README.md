# psychrometrics

In this project I used an existing library file to extract the information for a cooling tower. 
In a cooling tower certian parameters can change and lead to certain results in the tower. These parameters
include Dry-bulb temperature, Wet-bulb temperature, Dew point temperature, Specific Enthalpy, Specific Volume
Specific Humidity and Relative Humidity.
Based on the Psychrometrics chart, by giving only two of the above parameters the rest can be computed and 
displayed on screen.
